# 6.6 Automated Widget Testing in Flutter

## Example Code:

The code provided defines a test for de-facto Counter Flutter widget. 
The test ensures that the counter widget increments correctly.

The test first imports the flutter and flutter_test packages. 
The flutter package provides the Flutter widgets, while the flutter_test package provides the testing framework.

The test then imports the main.dart file, which contains the code for the Flutter widget.

The test then defines a test called Counter increments smoke test. 
The test uses the WidgetTester class to interact with the widget tree and to assert that the desired results are achieved.

The test first builds the widget tree and triggers a frame. 
This ensures that the widget tree is rendered to the screen.

The test then asserts that the counter starts at 0. 
This is done by calling the find.text() method with the text "0" as the argument. 
The find.text() method returns a Finder object, which can be used to interact with the widget tree.

The test then taps the + icon and triggers a frame. 
This ensures that the + icon is tapped and that the counter is incremented.

The test then asserts that the counter has incremented. 
This is done by calling the find.text() method with the text "1" as the argument.
The find.text() method returns a Finder object, which can be used to interact with the widget tree.

It uses the WidgetTester class to interact with the widget tree and to assert that the desired results are achieved.


```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:test_widget_app/main.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

    // Verify that our counter starts at 0.
    expect(find.text('0'), findsOneWidget);
    expect(find.text('1'), findsNothing);

    // Tap the '+' icon and trigger a frame.
    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.add));
    await tester.pump();

    // Verify that our counter has incremented.
    expect(find.text('0'), findsNothing);
    expect(find.text('1'), findsOneWidget);
  });
}
```
