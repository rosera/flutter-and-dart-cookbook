# 6.3 Running Unit Tests in Your Dart Application 

## Example Code:

The code provided defines a class called Travel. 
The Travel class has two constants: 
* convertToKilometers 
* convertToMiles. 

The constants are used to convert between kilometers and miles.

The Travel class also has a constructor that takes a distance in kilometers as an argument. 
The constructor sets the distance property to the value of the argument.

The Travel class has two methods: 
* distanceToMiles()
* distanceToKilometers(). 

The distanceToMiles() method returns the distance in miles. 
The distanceToKilometers() method returns the distance in kilometers.

```dart
import 'package:test_dart_sample/test_dart_sample.dart';

void main() {
  test('Travel Distance', () {
    // Arrange
    var distance = 10.0;
    var expectedDistance = distance;
    
    // Act
    var travel = Travel(expectedDistance);
    var result = travel.distance;
    
    // Assert
    expect(expectedDistance, result);
  });
}
```
