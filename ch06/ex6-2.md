# 6.2 Creating a Sample Test Application

## Example Code:

The code provided defines a class called Travel. 
The Travel class has two constants: 
* convertToKilometers 
* convertToMiles. 

The constants are used to convert between kilometers and miles.

The Travel class also has a constructor that takes a distance in kilometers as an argument. 
The constructor sets the distance property to the value of the argument.

The Travel class has two methods: 
* distanceToMiles() 
* distanceToKilometers(). 

The distanceToMiles() method returns the distance in miles. 
The distanceToKilometers() method returns the distance in kilometers.

```dart
const convertToKilometers = 1.60934;
const convertToMiles = 0.62137119;

class Travel {
  late double distance;
  Travel(double newDistance) {
    distance = newDistance;
  }

  double distanceToMiles() {
    return distance * convertToMiles;
  }

  double distanceToKilometers() {
    return distance * convertToKilometers;
  }
}
```
