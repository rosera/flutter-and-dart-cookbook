# Chapter 6 Creating A Sample Test Application

## Example Code:

The code provided defines a class called Travel. 
The Travel class has a property called distance, which is of type double.
The Travel class also has two methods: DistanceToMiles() and DistanceToKilometers().

The DistanceToMiles() method returns the distance in miles. 
The DistanceToKilometers() method returns the distance in kilometers.

The convertToMiles and convertToKilometers constants are used to convert between miles and kilometers.

```dart
const convertToKiloMeters = 1.60934;
const convertToMiles      = 0.62137119;

class Travel {
  late double distance;

  Travel(double newDistance) {
    distance = newDistance;
  }

  double DistanceToMiles() {
    return distance * convertToMiles;
  }

  double DistanceToKilometers() {
    return distance * convertToKiloMeters;
  }
}

```
