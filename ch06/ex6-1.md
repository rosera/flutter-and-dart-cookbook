# 6.1 Adding the Dart Test Package to Your Application 

## Example Code:

The command dart pub add test --dev adds the test package to your project as a development dependency. 
The test package provides a testing framework for Dart.

```bash
dart pub add test --dev
```

To use the test package, you need to import it into your code:

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';
```

You can then write tests using the test() function:

```dart
void main() {
  test('This is a test', () {
    // Your test code goes here.
  });
}
```

To use the test package, please see the documentation: [test package](https://pub.dev/packages/test).
