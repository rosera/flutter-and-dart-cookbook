# 1.4 Declaring a Bool variable

## Example Code:

* The first line declares a variable called myVariable and assigns it the type bool.
* The second line assigns the value true to the variable myVariable.
* The third line calls the print() function and passes the value of myVariable as an argument.
* The print() function will then print the value of myVariable to the console.

```dart 
void main() {
  bool myVariable = true;

  print(myVariable);
}
```
