# 2.7 How to handle Exceptions 

## Example Code

The indexOf() method throws a RangeError exception when the specified substring is not found. 
In this case, the substring name[0] is not found at the index name.length - (name.length+2), so the RangeError exception is thrown.
The try block is used to execute code that might cause an exception. 
The catch block is used to handle the exception. 
The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.
In this case, the try block executes the code that calls the indexOf() method. 
The indexOf() method throws a RangeError exception, which is caught by the catch block. 
The catch block prints the exception message to the console.
The finally block prints the message "Mission completed!" to the console. 
This message is always printed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

```dart
void main(){
  String name = "Dart";

  try{
    print ('Name: $name');

    // The following line generates a RangeError
    name.indexOf(name[0], name.length - (name.length+2));
  } catch (exception) {
    print ('Exception: $exception');
  } finally {
    print ('Mission completed!');
  }
}
```
 
## Example Output:

The result of the print statement is shown below:

```dart
Name: Dart
Exception: RangeError: Invalid value: Not in inclusive range 0..4: -2
Mission completed!
```
