# 2.11 How to use Import 

## Example Code

Generate a random number between 0 and 9, inclusive.
The Random() class is used to generate random numbers in Dart. 
The nextInt() method of the Random() class generates a random integer between 0 and the specified maximum value, exclusive. 
In this case, the maximum value is 10, so the random number will be between 0 and 9.
The print() function prints the value of the seed variable to the console.

A breakdown of the code:

* The first line imports the dart:math library, which contains the Random() class.
* The second line declares a variable called seed and assigns it the value of the nextInt() method of the Random() class.
* The third line calls the print() function and passes the value of the seed variable as an argument.
* The nextInt() method of the Random() class generates a random integer using a pseudorandom number generator. This means that the sequence of random numbers generated by the nextInt() method will be deterministic, given the same seed value.



```dart
import 'dart:math';

void main() {

  // Generate random number between 0-9
  int seed = Random().nextInt(10);
  
  print ('Seed: $seed');
}
```

## Example Output:

The result of the print statement is shown below:

```dart
Seed: 4
```

Note: As the seed variable is random, a different value may be shown at runtime.
