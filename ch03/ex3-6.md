# 3.6 Functional Delay using a Future 

## Example Code 

The main() function first prints the message "Hello" to the console. 
Then, the function calls the `_customDelay()` function with the argument myDelay.
The `_customDelay()` function is an asynchronous function, which means that it does not return immediately. Instead, it returns a Future object. The Future object will eventually be completed with the value of the delay argument.

The main() function then calls the await keyword on the Future object returned by the `_customDelay()` function. 
The await keyword tells the main() function to wait until the Future object is completed.
Once the Future object is completed, the main() function prints the value of the delay argument to the console.

The `_customDelay()` function uses the Future.delayed() method to create a Future object that will be completed after delay seconds.
The Future.delayed() method takes a Duration object as an argument. The Duration object specifies the amount of time to wait before completing the Future object.

If an error occurs while the `_customDelay()` function is running, the catch block will be executed. 
The catch block prints the error message to the console and returns the value of the delay argument.

```dart
void main() async {
  int myDelay = 5;
  print('Hello');
  var value = await _customDelay(myDelay);
  var customText = myDelay == 1 ? "second later" : "seconds later";
  print('Its $value $customText');
}

Future<int> _customDelay(int delay) async {
  try {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: delay));
    return delay;
  } catch (e) {
    print(e);
    return delay;
  }
}
```

## Example Output 

```dart
Hello
Its 5 seconds later
```
