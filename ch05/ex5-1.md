# 5.1 Creating a Class

## Example Code:

The code provided defines a class called DaysLeftInWeek. 
The class has two properties: 
* currentDay
* howManyDaysLeft. 

The currentDay property stores the current day of the week. 
The howManyDaysLeft property stores the number of days left in the week.

The class also has two constructors: the default constructor and a parameterized constructor. 
The default constructor initializes the currentDay property to the current day of the week. 
The parameterized constructor takes an integer argument as input and initializes the currentDay property to the value of the argument.

The class also has one method: howManyDaysLeft(). 
The howManyDaysLeft() method returns the number of days left in the week. 
The method subtracts the value of the currentDay property from the constant numDays.
The DaysLeftInWeek class constructor initializes the currentDay property to the current day of the week.
If today is Wednesday, then the value of currentDay will be 3. 
The howManyDaysLeft() method then returns the number of days left in the week, minus the current day of the week. 
In this case, there are 5 days left in the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday).


```dart
const numDays = 7;

class DaysLeftInWeek {
  int currentDay = 0;

  DaysLeftInWeek(){
    currentDay = DateTime.now().weekday.toInt();
  }

  int howManyDaysLeft(){
    return numDays - currentDay;
  }
}

void main() {
  DaysLeftInWeek daysLeftInWeek = DaysLeftInWeek();
  print(daysLeftInWeek.howManyDaysLeft());
}
```


## Example Output:
```dart
5
```
