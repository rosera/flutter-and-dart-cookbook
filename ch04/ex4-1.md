# 4.1 Creating Lists of Data

## Example Code:
The main() function first creates a list of months. 
The list contains the months January, February, and March. 
The function then calls the forEach() method on the list. 
The forEach() method iterates over the elements of the list and calls the specified function on each element.
In this case, the specified function is the print() function. 
The print() function prints the value of the current element to the console.

```dart
void main() {
  List listMonths = ['January', 'February', 'March'];
      listMonths.forEach(print);
}
```

## Example Output:
```dart
January
February
March
```
